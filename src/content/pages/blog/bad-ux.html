                    So you’ve got a website. You picked your colors, got a solid logo, and maybe
                    added some fun scrolling effects or animations to spice things up. It looks
                    good. You’ve put time into it. Maybe even money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But people are visiting and… not doing much else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They’re not clicking. They’re not booking. They’re not reaching out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If that’s happening, I’ll be straight with you:<br><strong>The issue
                    probably isn’t your design. It’s the experience.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most coaches and consultants don’t know they’re making these mistakes — but when
                    your site is doing very little to move people closer to working with you, you
                    sure can feel it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if you’re wondering why people are bouncing instead of buying, this post is
                    for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s talk about what’s really going on — and how to fix it.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>This Mistake Is More Common Than You Think</h2>
                    <p>
                        There’s a reason so many solo service providers run into user experience (UX)
                        issues. The internet is flooded with flashy templates and design trends. Sites
                        with clever wording, minimal navigation, and wild scrolling features are
                        everywhere — and they <em>look</em> successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So when you DIY your site — or even when you hire someone — it’s tempting to
                        lean into what’s trendy. You assume that if big brands are doing something, it
                        must be the right way to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But here’s the part most people don’t realize: <br><strong>Just because
                        something looks modern doesn’t mean it’s usable.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, in 2025 <a
                        href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/">Apple
                        released Liquid Glass</a>, its newest software design with iOS 26. It’s sleek,
                        cutting edge, and aesthetically pleasing at a glance. Plus, it’s Apple, so it
                        must be good, right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not so much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Liquid Glass is pretty, but <em>unusable</em>. Here are some of the issues I had
                        with it within an hour of updating my phone:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Impossible to read notifications over the light colored portions of my
                        wallpaper photo (problem: not enough contrast)</li>
                        <li>Hard to quickly find apps with all the colors removed (problem: apps are
                        less recognizable)</li>
                        <li>Unable to navigate between tabs in Safari after the interface changed
                        (problem: hidden essential functions)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        (This isn’t just my opinion; the Nielsen Norman Group, one of the top usability
                        research groups in the world, wrote about these issues and more in <a
                        href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/">Liquid Glass Is Cracked,
                        and Usability Suffers in iOS 26</a>.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe you’ve felt those frustrations, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyways, I bring this up to point out that Apple has resources, budgets, and
                        teams that are way beyond our reach as solo business owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They should know better, yet they still missed the mark on this one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s the truth: most of your prospects don’t care how slick your website
                        looks. They care about whether or not they can figure out what you do, why it
                        matters, and how to take the next step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s what UX — user experience — is really about. And it’s what your website
                        needs to get right if you want it to work <em>for</em> your business, not
                        against it.

                <h2>Why Bad UX Is Quietly Holding Your Business Back</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your website doesn’t need to win design awards. It needs to help your people get
                        what they came for — quickly, clearly, and without confusion. Bad UX gets in the
                        way of that. Every time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s how.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. It makes people give up before they even get started</h3>
                        <p>
                            Usability is a big deal. If someone lands on your website and can’t figure out
                            where to go or what you do, they’re going to leave. Not because your business
                            isn’t valuable, but because your site didn’t make it easy for them to stick
                            around.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to Microsoft, <a
                            href="https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-Report-DynService-2017-global-state-customer-service-en-au.pdf">56%
                            of people have stopped doing business with a brand because of poor digital
                            experiences</a>. That includes websites that are confusing, slow, or hard to
                            use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Think about your own behavior here. If you have a choice, do you stick around as
                            a customer if the website is a pain to use? I don’t.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So if your navigation is vague, your buttons aren’t clear, or your site is
                            glitchy on mobile… you're losing people who could’ve become clients.
                        </p>
                    <h3>2. It makes you look less credible than you are</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to Stanford, <a
                            href="https://credibility.stanford.edu/guidelines/index.html">75% of people
                            judge a company’s credibility based on its website design</a>. (So much for
                            don’t judge a book by its cover.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What does this mean? Even if your coaching gets results or your service is
                            top-notch, if your site feels janky, cluttered, or half-baked? People assume the
                            rest of your business is, too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your website is often your first impression. If it’s hard to use or doesn’t feel
                            professional, that can be enough to make someone second-guess hiring you — no
                            matter how good you actually are.
                        </p>
                    <h3>3. It drives up your marketing costs</h3>
                        <p>
                            Let’s be real: client acquisition is expensive. Whether you’re running ads,
                            posting content, or building a referral network, it takes time and effort to get
                            someone to your site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So when they land there and immediately bounce because of a bad experience?
                            That’s wasted effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s the kicker: Forrester research shows that <a
                            href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The-Six-Steps-For-Justifying-Better-UX/RES117708">a
                            well-designed user interface can increase conversion rates by up to 200%</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Good UX helps your website pull more weight. It turns visits into leads. It
                            gives people a reason to trust you. And it makes your entire marketing strategy
                            more effective.
                        </p>

                <h2>How I Know This Isn’t Just Theory</h2>
                    <p>
                        This isn’t something I read in a blog post once. I started learning about UX in
                        the trenches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 2021, I was working on the web team at the U.S. Department of State. One
                        of my first major projects in my new role as product owner? Building an
                        interactive world map that showed where the United States had donated COVID-19
                        vaccines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sounds simple. But maps are a UX minefield.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some countries — like Russia — are massive and easy to click. Others — like
                        Monaco — are so tiny they aren’t even visible. As a result, mobile users
                        couldn’t tap the right countries. And many people, myself included, don’t know
                        geography well enough to recognize what they’re looking for on a blank map.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So we didn’t just redesign the map — we rethought the experience entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We broke it into regional maps. We added clickable text lists. And on mobile? We
                        ditched the maps altogether and used plain text links, which were faster and
                        easier to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This wasn’t flashy. But it worked. Because we focused on what the user needed to
                        do — and made that part easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That same thinking applies to your website. You don’t need to impress people
                        with flashy bells and whistles. You need to help them understand what you do and
                        how to take the next step. The simpler, the better.

                <h2>What to Do Instead: Focus on These Three Core Areas</h2>
                    <p>
                        You don’t need to do a full UX audit or hire a research firm. But you
                        <em>do</em> need to think about your site from your user’s perspective — and
                        make sure it holds up in three key areas.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>1. Content: What It Says</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your content is more than just your message. It’s the guide your visitor relies
                            on to understand what you offer, how it helps, and what to do next.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s what to pay attention to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Navigation labels</strong> should be straightforward. Skip the
                            clever names. “Work With Me” is clearer than “The Journey.”</li>
                            <li><strong>Headings</strong> should help skimmers find what they need
                            fast.</li>
                            <li><strong>Link text</strong> should tell people what they’re clicking on.
                            “Click here” and “Learn more” aren’t enough.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buttons</strong> should have a clear action. “Book Your Free Call”
                            is better than “Submit.”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            These microcopy elements aren’t for unbridled creativity — they have a job. Your
                            top priority for them is clarity, followed by conciseness, and lastly character.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can still add a lot of personality to your website (heck, mine is
                            cat-themed), but if your words are vague, confusing, or trying too hard to sound
                            clever, your users won’t stick around to decode them.
                        </p>

                    <h3>2. Design: How It Looks</h3>
                        <p>
                            Good design supports good content. It makes it easier to read, easier to
                            navigate, and easier to take action. It also makes people more forgiving of
                            minor usability issues — that’s called the <a
                            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/">aesthetic-usability
                            effect</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Basically, people tend to think that if something <em>looks</em> good, it also
                            <em>works</em> good. (Remember how 75% of people judge a company’s credibility
                            based on its website?)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that investing in design pays off.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don’t have time to dive into design principles and psychology in this post,
                            but here are a few quick tips:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A clear <strong>visual hierarchy </strong>— what’s most important should
                            stand out immediately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consistency</strong> with fonts, colors, and spacing across your
                            site.</li>
                            <li>Smart use of <strong>design principles</strong> like grouping related
                            content together so people understand what goes with what.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You don’t need a minimalist layout or some designer-chic look. You need a layout
                            that helps people process what they’re seeing without working too hard.
                        </p>

                    <h3>3. Tech: How It Works</h3>
                        <p>
                            If your site doesn’t <em>function</em>, nothing else matters. The best content
                            and design can’t make up for a broken or slow site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is where things can get very, well, technical. It quickly becomes
                            overwhelming if you don’t speak developer, and I’ll be honest, a lot of it still
                            goes over my head.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s your non-technical tech checklist:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Does your site load fast?</strong> It should load in under 3
                            seconds. </li>
                            <li><strong>Is it mobile-friendly?</strong> You should not have to awkwardly
                            scroll sideways at all.</li>
                            <li><strong>Do all the links and buttons work?</strong> Watch for 404 errors and
                            test that form submissions work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Are your images compressed properly?</strong> Aim to keep all images
                            under 50KB to help your website load quickly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Some of these issues are harder to fix than others, but they are all critical
                            for a good user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your site’s slow, glitchy, or broken on mobile, people will leave. Not
                            because they’re impatient — but because we’ve all been trained to expect
                            websites to work. If yours doesn’t, people won’t make excuses for it. They’ll
                            just go elsewhere.
                        </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Bonus: Accessibility Is Just Good UX</h3>
                        <p>
                            Accessibility isn’t some extra feature you add at the end. It’s built into good
                            design, good content, and good tech.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clear link text helps screen readers <em>and</em> fast readers.</li>
                            <li>High contrast helps low-vision users <em>and</em> people using your site
                            outside in the sun.</li>
                            <li>Mobile-friendly design helps <em>everyone</em> on their phone — which is
                            most people these days.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Accessibility doesn’t just help a few people. It improves the experience for
                            <em>all</em> your users. And it’s worth taking seriously.

                <h2>What This Looks Like in Practice</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most professionals specialize in one of these areas. If you want words, hire a
                        copywriter. If you want looks, hire a graphic designer. And if you want code,
                        hire a developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have the resources to hire a team of specialists who work well together,
                        by all means hire the dream team. But as I’ve shown, you really need all three
                        areas supporting each other — hiring one or two specialists ain’t gonna cut it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, if you have time and budget constraints, a generalist, like me,
                        might be a better fit. My knowledge may not be as deep as a specialist’s, but I
                        make up for that with breadth and crossing disciplines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In <a href="/storycraft/">Storycraft</a>, my done-for-you website package, I take care of
                        all this for you.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I write your content with a focus on clarity, tone, and conversion.</li>
                        <li>I design a layout that fits your brand but keeps the user experience front
                        and center.</li>
                        <li>I code mobile-first and optimize for fast loading times and clean
                        functionality.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        UX isn’t an afterthought. It’s baked into every step. Because you shouldn’t have
                        to figure this stuff out on your own — or settle for a site that just “looks
                        nice.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When your website actually <em>works</em> the way it should, you:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Convert more visitors into leads</li>
                        <li>Look like the capable, trustworthy pro you are</li>
                        <li>Feel confident sending people to your site, knowing it’s pulling its
                        weight<br></li>
                    </ul>
                <hr>
                <h2>“This Feels Like a Lot. Where Should I Start?”</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fair question. You don’t have to fix everything at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s what I’d recommend doing first:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Do the squint test.<br></strong>Pull up your homepage. Squint
                        your eyes. What jumps out first? If it’s not your main heading and CTA, adjust
                        the colors, size, or placement so those stand out more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fix your link text.<br></strong>Search your site for any
                        “click here” or “learn more” links. Replace them with something more
                        descriptive. What is someone actually clicking on?</li>
                        <li><strong>Check your images.<br></strong>Are your file sizes way bigger
                        than they need to be? Resize your images to 2x the display size, max, and
                        compress the files. This alone can speed up your site dramatically.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        These are small changes — but they make a difference. Especially if your site
                        has been sitting untouched for a while.

                <h2>Let Your Website Start Doing Its Job</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your website looks good but isn’t converting, it’s probably not a design
                        issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s the experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The good news? You can fix that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can build a site that’s simple, clear, and functional — without sacrificing
                        style. One that helps people quickly understand what you do and decide to take
                        the next step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if you don’t want to do it all yourself? That’s what I’m here for.
