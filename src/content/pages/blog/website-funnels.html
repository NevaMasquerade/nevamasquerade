                    Have you invested blood, sweat, and tears into your website? But despite all that effort… it’s not doing much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe you spent countless weekends learning to do it all yourself. <br>Maybe you hired a designer or bought a luxury template. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You've got brand colors, some punchy copy, maybe a few testimonials. <br>You're showing up on social media, getting traffic to the site, and people are clicking around — but they’re not booking. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What gives?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s the answer, in plain terms: <strong>you don’t have a funnel</strong>. You have a brochure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most DIY websites are built around “having all the pages” and “looking legit.” That’s enough to make you look professional, but that doesn’t mean it’ll actually convert. If you want sales, you need more than just aesthetics — <strong>you need strategy</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when you have the right strategy? Your site becomes a sales tool that does the heavy lifting for you — so you don’t have to chase every lead or constantly explain what you do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>You’re not wrong for wanting this.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wanting your website to bring in more aligned leads, book more sales calls, or help people self-select into your offers before they ever get on Zoom with you? That’s smart. That’s <em>what a website should do</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your website has a clear funnel:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It feels intentional. You’re no longer copying competitors or writing what you “think you’re supposed to say.”</li>
                    <li>You stop feeling embarrassed when someone asks for your link. You know it represents you well.</li>
                    <li>People show up to your sales calls already trusting you and ready to move forward.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    So, let’s talk about how you can shift from “I hope this works” to “My website <em>works</em>.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post, I’m walking you through <strong>3 website strategies</strong> that help solo coaches and service providers turn your site’s visitors into buyers. These are the same strategies I use for my own site and inside my paid offers. They’re simple, smart, and designed specifically for solo business owners like you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s get into it.
                </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Strategy 1: Pick ONE next step — and make it obvious</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is where most websites go sideways. You’ve got multiple offers, a bunch of links in the menu, a few opt-ins, and you’re trying to make sure everyone sees <em>everything</em>. I get it, we’ve all been there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that’s not how people are wired. <strong>If you give someone too many options, the easiest option is to do nothing</strong>. Choice paralysis, information overload, a high cognitive load — whatever you want to call it, <a href="https://cxl.com/blog/reducing-cognitive-load/">it costs conversions</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having <em>one </em>next step doesn’t mean you ignore your other offers. It just means you build your site around one clear conversion action — the one you want most people to take.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This one step could be:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Booking a discovery call</li>
                        <li>Buying a signature offer</li>
                        <li>Filling out an application</li>
                        <li>Starting with your intro service</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Everything else? Secondary. Supportive. But not competing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What it looks like in practice:<br><strong>Every page </strong>on your site should have<strong> one obvious, consistent CTA</strong>. It should go to the same place and say the same thing. On my site, you’ll see a pink button labeled “Start Your Story” that takes you to my Calendly to book a call. You’ll find it at key points across the pages (including at the end of this post).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also use two other types of CTAs:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Subtle CTAs</strong>: All-caps text that’s styled differently from regular copy. These guide people to sections or secondary pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary CTAs</strong>: Buttons that show up <em>only</em> on my Services page to point people toward my individual offers (<a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/frame/">Frame</a>, <a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/voice/">Voice</a>, and <a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/storycraft/">Storycraft</a>). These are less prominent than the main CTA.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        When we work together in <a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/storycraft/">Storycraft</a>, I’ll help you figure out what your “one next step” should be, then we’ll implement a CTA system that works across your entire site — visually and strategically. We’ll use design hierarchy, copy, and placement to make it easy for your site to do its job: guide visitors toward becoming clients.
                    </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Strategy 2: Turn your About + Services pages into sales funnel assets</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most people treat their About page like a bio and their Services page like a menu. That’s fine… if you want your site to be purely informational.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if you want your website to <em>convert</em>, these pages have to do more than explain what you do. They need to make people <em>feel confident</em> about working with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s talk stats for a second:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>52% of website visitors say they look for an About page first.</li>
                        <li>31% say it’s the <em>most important</em> part of the website.</li>
                        <li>63% of people prefer to buy from brands that have a clear purpose.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        (Source: <a href="https://www.businessdasher.com/research/statistics-about-website/">Business Dasher</a>)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means your About page is <em>prime real estate</em>. It’s where people go to find the “why” behind what you do — and whether it aligns with them. So make it count.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s how I built my About page (using one of the frameworks from my <a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/blog/storycraft-atlas/">Storycraft Atlas</a>):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hero section</strong> that clearly states what I do and who I do it for</li>
                        <li><strong>Subtle CTA</strong> to my Start Here page</li>
                        <li><strong>Founder's story</strong> that connects my background to my offer</li>
                        <li><strong>Belief filter</strong> to build values alignment (and weed out bad fits)</li>
                        <li><strong>Process snapshot</strong> showing what it’s like to work with me</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal detail</strong> to humanize and differentiate me</li>
                        <li><strong>Primary CTA</strong> to book a call </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        And your Services page? That’s where you help them <em>decide</em>. You’re not just listing your offers — you’re guiding them through which offer is right, how it works, and what the next move is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My Services page includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>direct hero section</strong> with a subtle CTA to jump to pricing</li>
                        <li>An abbreviated version of <strong>my story</strong> for context</li>
                        <li>Overview of my <strong>three main offers</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>FAQs</strong> to answer objections</li>
                        <li><strong>Primary CTA</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        When we work together, I bring a flexible framework to both of these pages. My <strong><a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/blog/storycraft-atlas/">Storycraft Atlas</a></strong> includes multiple frameworks (not templates) for About and Services pages. We choose the ones that best fit your business model and brand, and then we customize them with your words, your voice, and your offers.

                <h2>Strategy 3: Use your blog as a trust-building machine (not an SEO grind)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let me be blunt: blogging <em>does not</em> need to feel like a full-time job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You don’t need to write every week.<br>You don’t need to “crack” Google’s algorithm.<br>You don’t need to cover every topic under the sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You need a blog that builds trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your blog’s job is to warm up people who already know about you. Maybe they came from your Instagram. Maybe they heard you on a podcast. Maybe a past client shared your link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once they land on your site and start reading, your posts should answer their questions, show your expertise, and help them realize: <em>“Wow, this person gets it. I want to work with them.”</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>So here’s my recommendation:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write 12–20 <em>strategic</em> posts.</li>
                        <li>Focus on topics that support your offer, handle objections, and show how you think.</li>
                        <li>Link them to each other (strategically) so visitors can binge.</li>
                        <li>Periodically update them to keep things fresh.</li>
                        <li>Promote them via your own channels — email, socials, and partnerships.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This is called building a <em>core content library</em>. Once it’s live, you can reuse those posts everywhere. You don’t need to keep churning out new content just for the sake of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t offer blog writing as a service. But inside <strong><a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/frame">Frame</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/storycraft/">Storycraft</a></strong>, I can set you up with a simple CMS so you can manage your blog on your own.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>A quick reality check before you head off and rebuild everything</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before we wrap up, let’s pause and acknowledge something important: <strong>funnels aren’t one-size-fits-all</strong>. There’s no single “perfect” setup or magic layout that works for every business. Your website is one part of a much larger picture that includes how you show up on other platforms — email, social media, podcast interviews, referrals — and how those channels all feed into and out of each other.

                    <p>
                        This post doesn’t cover all of that, and honestly? That’s on purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not trying to teach you the <em>entire</em> science of funnel building here. I’m giving you three foundational strategies that you can use without any automations or outside tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These strategies are a starting point. They won’t solve <em>everything,</em> and they’re not meant to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, with that said, let’s talk through a few things that might be running through your mind right now:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>“If I only have one CTA, won’t that limit what I can sell?”</h3>
                        <p>
                            Nope. <strong>One primary CTA doesn’t mean you throw the rest of your offers in the trash</strong>. It means you're being clear about the <em>main path</em> you want people to take. Think of it like signage: when people land on your website, they should know exactly where to go next. That doesn’t mean you can’t offer multiple services or have more than one sales page. It just means you’re removing friction for most visitors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In practice, you can still use subtle or secondary CTAs for other offers or pathways — but your site isn’t leaving the decision-making entirely up to your audience. You’re guiding them. That’s helpful, not limiting.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3>“I don’t want to come across as pushy or salesy.”</h3>
                        <p>
                            Totally fair. I don’t either. Having a funnel doesn’t mean slapping pop-ups on every page (please do not do that) or pretending your business is something it’s not. What we’re talking about here is simply <em>structure</em>. Structure that helps your people understand what you do, how you help, and what to do next if they want in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your offer can genuinely help someone, then <strong>making it easier for them to say yes isn’t manipulative</strong> — it’s respectful of their time and attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The key is to communicate with honesty, clarity, and a voice that actually sounds like you. The good news is: that’s what I build with and for my clients.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3>“Blogging takes too long. I need leads now.”</h3>
                        <p>
                            Valid. Creating content takes time — and if you’re already wearing 10 hats in your business, blogging can feel like one more thing you “should” be doing but never quite get to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s how I think about it: blog posts don’t have to be frequent or long to be valuable. They just need to be <em>useful and strategic.</em> Especially if you're already active on email or social media, your blog can serve as a central hub — a place where deeper content lives and where you can send people when they’re ready to learn more or take action.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, <strong>you don’t have to write blog posts <em>for</em> SEO</strong>. In fact, unless you’re willing to pay an SEO expert a lot of money or your niche is wildly non-competitive, SEO is probably a waste of time. I know that’s sacrilegious for a web strategist to say, but it’s true: there are billions of websites, and most of them will never rank. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of writing for cold leads that may never arrive, focus on the warm leads already in your ecosystem. You can link to blog posts in your emails. You can reference them in DMs. You can repurpose snippets on Instagram. Your blog doesn’t have to drive traffic. It can help convert the traffic you already have.

                <h2>Recap: What We Covered</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your website isn’t converting, the fix isn’t a rebrand or prettier graphics. It’s strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are the 3 website strategies that actually move the needle:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>One Clear CTA</strong> — Pick the next step you want people to take, and design your whole site around it.</li>
                        <li><strong>About + Services Pages as Funnel Assets</strong> — Don’t just inform. Guide, build trust, and create momentum.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Blog Content</strong> — Write once, reuse often, and use blog posts to build authority and demand.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        When you implement these strategies, your website goes from passive placeholder to active sales tool. You get more aligned clients, more confident sales calls, and more time to do the actual work you love.

                <h2>Ready for your website to actually do something?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your website looks nice but isn’t pulling its weight… that’s fixable. And you don’t need to scrap everything or start from zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What you <em>do</em> need is a clear next step, more intentional structure, and a funnel that matches the way you actually sell your services. That’s exactly what I help with.
